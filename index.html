              Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but
              is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on
              waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
              applied science.

              pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
              program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
              strains of disease resistent wheat including different varieties
              for each major climate on Earth.

              American breed, creating a strain that responds well to
              fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.

              Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can
              meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
              are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
              modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we
              called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
